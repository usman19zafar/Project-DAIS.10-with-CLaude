3. THE MATH OF CAPACITY
Work Capacity Per Week
Code
Category A: 50 people × 40 hrs = 2,000 hrs/week
Category E: 1 person × 10 hrs =    10 hrs/week
Ratio
Code
200:1
A large team produces in one week what a solo founder produces in four months.

4. WHAT LARGE TEAMS CAN DO THAT A SOLO FOUNDER CANNOT
Category A (Open‑Source Scale)
Build new features rapidly

Announce to massive communities

Integrate across ecosystems

Out‑market any individual

Dominate search visibility

Replicate ideas quickly

Category B (Mid‑Scale Platforms)
Add new modules in months

Sell instantly to existing customers

Close enterprise deals

Raise additional capital

Scale distribution

Category C (Enterprise Platforms)
Acquire smaller frameworks

Build simplified versions

Access executive buyers

Influence enterprise standards

Category D (Transformation Tools)
Add semantic testing to pipelines

Broadcast to large communities

Establish de facto standards

5. WHAT DAIS‑10 HAS THAT OTHERS DO NOT
Mathematical rigor (4 proven theorems)

Temporal decay model (DIFS‑10)

Meaning‑centric architecture

Novel semantic weighting system

Complete 8‑engine implementation

Founder‑grade precision and passion

6. THE BRUTAL REALITY
DAIS‑10 has the strongest mathematics.
Others have the strongest distribution.

In theory:

Best product wins.

In practice:

Best distribution wins.

7. YOUR STRATEGIC OPTIONS (SANITIZED)
Code
Option 1: Direct Competition
Outcome: Low probability (resource mismatch)

Option 2: Asymmetric Strategy
Outcome: Possible (requires precision)

Option 3: Acquisition Path
Outcome: Framework survives, identity diluted

Option 4: Become a Protocol
Outcome: High leverage (others implement your standard)

Option 5: Regulatory Alignment
Outcome: Long-term (3–5 years)

Option 6: Abandonment
Outcome: Framework dies quietly
Right now, by doing nothing, the default is Option 6.
