DAIS‑10 STRATEGIC PLAN (SANITIZED EDITION)
Option 2 + Option 4: Asymmetric Warfare + Become the Protocol
THE STRATEGY: DAIS‑10 AS INFRASTRUCTURE
DAIS‑10 should not compete with tools.
DAIS‑10 should become the semantic protocol that tools implement.

Think of it like:

HTTP → browsers

SQL → databases

Git → hosting platforms

DAIS‑10 → data quality ecosystem

You become the standard.
They become the implementations.

THE 18‑MONTH PLAYBOOK (SANITIZED)
PHASE 1 — PROOF OF CONCEPT (Months 1–3)
Goal: One real‑world success story.

Actions
Find one organization with a high‑impact semantic failure:

Healthcare: missing clinical data

Finance: audit inconsistencies

Manufacturing: safety‑critical attributes

Implement DAIS‑10 for them (free).

Integrate with their existing pipelines.

Document measurable outcomes:

Code
Alert noise reduced: 90%
Critical issues caught: 100%
Engineering time saved: X hours/week
Cost savings: $Y/month
Deliverable: One case study with real numbers.

PHASE 2 — ACADEMIC VALIDATION (Months 2–4, parallel)
Goal: Legitimacy through peer review.

Actions
Write a formal paper:

Title: “DAIS‑10: A Mathematical Framework for Semantic Data Classification”

Include: 4 theorems, proofs, benchmarks, case study

Publish to:

Preprint servers

Data engineering communities

Technical blogs

Deliverable: Published paper = credibility.

PHASE 3 — OPEN SOURCE ECOSYSTEM (Months 3–6)
Goal: Make DAIS‑10 trivial to adopt.

Actions
Build integrations for major categories of tools:

Code
dais10-validator
dais10-transform
dais10-monitor
dais10-orchestrator
Make installation effortless:

bash
pip install dais10-validator
Provide:

5‑minute quickstart

Video walkthrough

Migration guide

Deliverable: A plug‑and‑play ecosystem.

PHASE 4 — COMMUNITY BUILDING (Months 4–9)
Goal: Create momentum.

Actions
Weekly content:

“Why equal‑weight validation fails”

“Semantic tiers in real systems”

“How DAIS‑10 prevents critical failures”

Post to:

Data engineering forums

Technical communities

Professional networks

Deliverable: Growing awareness and early adopters.

PHASE 5 — REGULATORY ALIGNMENT (Months 6–12)
Goal: Make DAIS‑10 compliance‑relevant.

Actions
Healthcare whitepaper:

“DAIS‑10 for clinical data safety”

Finance whitepaper:

“DAIS‑10 for audit integrity”

Submit DAIS‑10 to standards bodies:

As a semantic classification guideline

As an implementation layer for existing quality standards

Deliverable: One regulatory mention.

PHASE 6 — PLATFORM PARTNERSHIPS (Months 9–18)
Goal: Get a major platform to implement DAIS‑10.

Actions
Approach categories of tools with:

“We built a DAIS‑10 plugin your users already adopted.”

“We can help you integrate semantic tiers natively.”

“This is a differentiator for your platform.”

Deliverable: One major platform integration.

WHY THIS WORKS (SANITIZED)
1. You’re not competing — you’re augmenting.
You’re not building “DAIS‑10 vs validation tools.”
You’re building “DAIS‑10 for validation tools.”

2. You move where large teams cannot.
Academic rigor

Regulatory alignment

Protocol‑level standardization

These are slow for large organizations.

3. You create value for them.
You’re giving them features their users want.

4. You build a moat.
Academic paper

Regulatory mention

Platform integration

By the time anyone copies you, you’re the standard.

RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS (SANITIZED)
Time
15–20 hours/week for 18 months.

Support
1–2 technical writers (contract)

1 regulatory consultant (contract)

Cost
$15–20K total.

Community
Free — just your time.

This is achievable for one founder.

THE CRITICAL INSIGHT
You cannot out‑resource large teams.
But you can out‑maneuver them.

They build products.
You build infrastructure.

They defend market share.
You create a category.

THE ASK
Are you willing to:

Commit 15–20 hours/week

Invest ~$20K

Build in public

Produce one case study

Publish one academic paper

Build integrations

Push DAIS‑10 as a protocol

If yes, I can help you build:

The case study pitch deck

The academic paper outline

The integration architecture

The content plan

The regulatory whitepaper

The platform pitch

But only if you’re actually going to execute.
